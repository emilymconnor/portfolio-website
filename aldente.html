            <p>
               The app Al Dente is a case study developed as part of a UI Design program I attended in 2021. The aim was to design a recipe responsive web app.  As someone who has been passionate about vegan food for 15 years, I knew I wanted to focus the project around delicious vegan recipes. Through personal experience, I’ve seen the lack of clean, easy to understand, and visually appealing vegan recipe applications on the market. Most are  text heavy blogs with an excessive amount of ads. With this experience in mind, I was able to create a hypothesis, test it with users, and validate my ideas. This love for food and design is the reason Al Dente has come to be.

               Buon Appetito!

            <h2>My Process</h2>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
               We believe that providing a large database of vegan recipes will result in users feeling
               inspired while having a more enjoyable
               cooking experience. <br>
               We believe that by providing users with clear instructions, appealing images, and reviews on recipes it will result in a more trustworthy
               product for users to use and a more visually
            </p>
            <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Track amount of users leaving reviews on recipes
               <li>Number of downloads
               <li>Increase in reputation among the vegan and non-vegan communities
               <li>Most searched recipe names
               <li>Most searched ingredients
            </ul>
            <h3>User Personas</h3>
            <p>
               When creating user personas for Al Dente, I referenced knowledge gained through user interviews to bring the data to life. The conducted interviews were via Skype as well as in person. For each, I came prepared with a set number of targeted questions but more importantly wanted to hear each users real life experiences. I was able to locate some pain points that I had hypothesized in current recipe applications as well as find important features users are looking for in a future products that I had not identified myself. Users interviewed were vegan and non-vegan eaters, which resulted in well rounded answers.

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <h4>Goal</h4>
            <p>
               The goal of my user testing was to assess the overall usability of my product on a mobile phone and identify any issues with the design. Users were given three objectives to achieve while navigating through the design. Each were asked to verbally walk through each step and express any troubles or ease they experienced. I was able to synthesize these results to further my work and modify the design to better serve the user.
            </p>
            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Test users ability to leave a review on a recipe
               <li>Test users ability to bookmark a recipe
               <li>Test users ability to save an ingredient
            </ul>
            <h3>Testing Synthesis</h3>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Search refinement not available on recipe homepage
               <li>User not able to type in their own grocery list items
               <li>Confused by ‘Summer Edit’
               <li>No confirmation screen when completing a task
            </ul>
            <h4>Suggestion</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Need to add a back feature on all screens to ensure users can retrace their steps if they make a mistake
               <li>Add a search refinement on the homepage
               <li>Add a fill in option on the grocery list for users to customize and make their own
               <li>Use better wording when explaining the different grouping of recipes on the homepage to make it more clear what they mean to the user
               <li>Add confirmation screens when a user completes a task
            </ul>
